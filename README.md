Directory contents:

-Makefile
-memchunk.c
-memchunk.h

Build Instructions:

option 1:
In order to run the code as I did simply type make into the command line
with main.c, memchunk.c, and memchunk.h in the same directory as the Makefile.

option2:
You can use your own Makefile, but be sure that you have memchunk.c and memchunk.h
in the same directory and have them linked to your test function.

Running Instructions:

If you used option 1 for building simplly type the following into your command line:

./test size

Where size is the number of memchunk array entries you want
